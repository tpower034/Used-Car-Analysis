***About:***
For this project I wanted to take a look into the used car market. During covid there has been a large increase in the price of used cars. I want to take a step back and dive into the correlations of the price of the cars prior to covid and see the trends. 

***Goal:***
The goal of this project is to determine the correlated between selling price, year, and odometer reading. I also want to determine the equation that predicts car prices based on year and mileage.

***How to Run:***
